    <td>Nothing limited my learning except for when I had to change computers as the one I was on wasn't going off power saving mode and the second monitor had something wrong with the HDMI cable. Then I couldn't get my second computer to start up so I asked for help however this wasted some time which affected my first assignment and I couldn't hand in a very good piece of work.</td>

    <td>Pick a better computer from the start! Review my work at home and create more coding replâ€™s to get better.</td>
